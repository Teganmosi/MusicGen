# MusicGen
This GitHub repository contains code for generating music from text using the Audiocraft library.


The repository includes the following steps:

1. Installing the required dependencies, including the Audiocraft library.
2. Importing necessary modules from the Audiocraft library and other dependencies.
3. Loading a pre-trained music generation model from the Audiocraft library.
4. Setting the generation parameters, such as the duration of the generated music.
5. Generating music based on provided descriptions using the loaded model.
6. Displaying the generated music as an audio file.

This code allows users to easily generate music by providing textual descriptions of the desired music style or characteristics. The Audiocraft library and the pre-trained model provide the necessary tools and capabilities for music generation. This repository serves as a demonstration and starting point for experimenting with music generation using Audiocraft.
